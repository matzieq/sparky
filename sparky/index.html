              >Thank you for checking out sparky! Just a quick heads up: sparky
              is in an early stage of development. It's functional, but may
              include rough edges and bugs. It is, however updated (reasonably)
              often, and updated a lot, so these keep disappearing even as I
              write these words.

            Sparky is a set of simple open source tools to create<br />
            tiny web games in Javascript
          </h2>
          <img src="assets/images/game.png" alt="Game screenshot" />
          <p>
            Sparky is inspired by Pico-8, the Pyxel Engine and similar fantasy
            consoles and fantasy-console-likes. It provides a simple set of
            tools to draw sprites, tilemaps, create sounds and write code, along
            with a tiny Javascript library with API modelled after the Pico-8.
          </p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Simple and easy to use</h3>
            <p>
              The tools are simple and there is no setup, as the environment is
              self-contained. All you need is open the editor in a browser, make
              your game and click "export".
            </p>
            <h3>Constraints to fuel creativity...</h3>
            <p>
              Taking inspiration from fantasy consoles, sparky provides you with
              limited resources to work with. This way it's hard to get too
              carried away, and you can finish your game quickly.
            </p>
            <h3>...but you can cheat!</h3>
            <p>
              At its heart, Sparky is just a library, so it does not impose any
              code limitations. You can also download the game template and code
              the game externally, including multiple sets of assets if you
              really want.
            </p>
            <h3>It's just plain Javascript</h3>
            <p>
              No complex build tools or advanced features. Make the entire game
              in the browser and export with one click - or simply plug in the
              library in a script tag, along with the data generated from the
              editor and your own code, just like in the olden days.
            </p>
            <h3>Batteries included</h3>
            <p>
              Sparky gives you all the tools you need to create tiny pixel art
              games. The game editor allows you to create assets and save them
              on your machine, as well as a code editor and the ability to
              export the game. The library provides basic functions for display,
              input, sounds and a game loop.
            </p>
            <h3>It's really tiny</h3>
            <p>
              Game size is measured in kilobytes. A game is just an html file
              that you can double click and launch in any browser.
            </p>
            <h3>...and it's open source</h3>
            <p>
              Every last bit of code, including this website, is free software,
              licensed under the MIT licence. So pop the hood and hack away to
              your heart's content.

          <h2>Game editor</h2>
          <p>
            Use the editor to create images, maps, sounds and code for your
            game. Export the game straight from the editor, or save it as a
            javascript file that you just embed into your own HTML together with
            the library and your own code.
          </p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Use the sprite editor to draw your sprites</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/sprite-editor.png"
              alt="Sprite editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You get a total of 256 8x8 pixel sprites and a 6 color palette.
              You can then draw them in your game by simply referring to their
              numbers.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Use the tilemap editor to create maps using the sprites you've
              drawn
            </h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/tile-editor.png"
              alt="Tilemap editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You get a total of 8x8 screens of 16x16 tiles. Use the sprites
              you've drawn in the sprite editor to fill your maps. You can also
              change the map programmatically in game code by simply referring
              to tile coordinates. Drawing a map in your game is as simple as
              <span class="code">map()</span>.
            </p>
            <h3>Use the SFX editor to make bleeps and bloops</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/sfx-editor.png"
              alt="SFX editor screenshot"
            />
            <p>
              You can make 32 sound effects, each consisting of 32 segments.
              There are several waveforms and special effects to spice things
              up. You can also make some simple music in the editor, although a
              more advanced tracker-like music editor is in the works as we
              speak.

          <h2>Library</h2>
          <p>
            The sparky library is just a bunch of functions to make it as easy
            and painless as possible to display things on the screen, read input
            and make some noise. It abstracts away the chores and many decisions
            that would lead to analysis paralysis. All games use a 128x128
            resolution, a fixed 6 color palette and a limited set of resources
            you create in the editor. This way it takes very little code to get
            up and running.
          </p>

              alt="Display created with the code"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            It's just Javascript, so you can use any sort of library and built
            in functionality you wish. The opportunities for creativity are
            endless.
