            Husband of a lovely wife, father of a beautiful boy and two cats,
            front-end developer by day, game developer by night.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The usual story. I always wanted to make games. The world convinced
            me that I couldn't do that. After several long years I became the
            President of Space and decided that nobody would prevent me from
            making games, so I started doing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm mainly interested in old-school retro pixel look and
            (especially) sound. I love old arcade games from the 70s and the 80s
            and that's what I'm going to be building while I gain my levels in
            gamemaking wizardry. Expect a lot of lasers, dragons, martians,
            dinosaurs, robots, ninjas and samurai. I'll try to stay away from
            zombies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, none of this would have happened without the absolutely
            unbelievable and incredible support of my wife Anna who is the wind
            in my sails and whose encouragement was the force that got me to
            publish anything at all.
